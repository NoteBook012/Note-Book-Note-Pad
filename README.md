## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser. A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for development.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NoteBook012/Note-Book-Note-Pad.git
