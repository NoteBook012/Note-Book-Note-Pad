## üöÄ How to Setup and Run
This project is a self-contained `index.html` file, making it incredibly simple to deploy.

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
The AI Assistant requires a Google AI API key to function.

1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
2.  Sign in and click **"Create API key"**.
3.  Copy your new API key. **Keep this key private.**

### Step 2: Add Your API Key to `index.html`
You need to place your secret API key directly into the `index.html` file.

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2.  Find this line of code (it's inside a `<script type="module">` tag near the end of the file):
    ```javascript
    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
    ```
3.  **Replace** `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual API key inside single quotes.

    For example, if your key is `AIzaSy...`, the line should look like this:
    ```javascript
    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: 'AIzaSy...' });
    ```

> **Security Warning:** This method is simple but makes your API key public. For a personal project, this is acceptable. For a large-scale production app, you should use a backend server to protect your key.

### Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Simply commit and push the updated `index.html` file to the GitHub repository that hosts your website. GitHub Pages will handle the rest.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **AI Integration:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
